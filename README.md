# choice_program
# This program is good for teachers to use when they want to randomly present students.
# A random presentation program has been developed for one class. But there is no random presentation program that puts and manages students in various classes, so I developed it.
# I wanted to implement everything in gui using Thinker, But I couldn't find a way to connect the window to window, so I finished the project as it is.
